## üîß Notes

- `:slug`, `:id`, `:question_slug`, and `:answer_id` are dynamic route parameters.
- Use Bearer token authentication (`Authorization: Bearer {{token}}`) where required.
- All requests/response bodies are JSON.

---

## üß™ Postman Usage

To test these endpoints:
1. Import the `StackIt Copy.postman_collection.json` into Postman.
2. Set the environment variable `base_url` to your backend server URL.
3. Register or login to obtain a JWT token and set it as `token` in the environment.
